Leo Medistein—a witty, womanizing, ambitious banker—struggles to maintain a monopolistic control of magic known as Essemancy. But when a disastrous betrayal happens with the Imperial crown and church, opposing values of power test the truth and love of familial bonds as each member decides what’s worth fighting for: their survival, their family, or an empire.

Book Blurb:
The Primordials gods bestowed the knowledge of magic to man. Harnessing these gifts, the Traessyean Empire conquered the world, only to fall from internal corruption after a thousand-year rule. The secrets of magic were forgotten. A new empire rose from the void of power, forged with faith, steel, and wealth. The burghers of House Medistein’s rapid ascension is accredited to their salt monopoly and the rediscovery of magic. Legacy institutions grow envious waiting for the time to seize salts and their magical power from the upstart Medistein house.
Religious tensions simmer within the empire held together by a fragile truce. The Imperial Throne struggles to maintain order. In a world filled with ambiguity, the Medistein family questions if yesterday’s friends are tomorrow’s foes. Families fight among themselves more than they fight with their rivals. History remembers this is an age of scheming nobles, greedy merchants, powerful magi, and zealous priests. Nothing is certain in perilous times, not gold nor god nor glory. Each person seeks to discover the Essence of the Empire.
